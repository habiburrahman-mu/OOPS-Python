### Encapsulation
*In object-oriented programming (OOP, encapsulation refers to the bundling of data with the methods that operate on that data, or the restricting of direct access to some of an object's components. Encapsulation is used to hide the values or state of a structured data object inside a class, preventing direct access to them by clients in a way that could expose hidden implementation details or violate state invariance maintained by the methods.*

- [rectangle_encapsulation.py](rectangle_encapsulation.py)

#### Private Method

*Private methods are those methods which can't be accessed in other class except the class in which they are declared. We can perform the functionality only within the class in which they are declared.*

*Private methods are useful for breaking tasks up into smaller parts, or for preventing duplication of code which is needed often by other methods in a class, but should not be called outside of that class.*
