# OOPS-Python
Object Oriented Programming using Python

### Encapsulation
*In object-oriented programming (OOP, encapsulation refers to the bundling of data with the methods that operate on that data, or the restricting of direct access to some of an object's components. Encapsulation is used to hide the values or state of a structured data object inside a class, preventing direct access to them by clients in a way that could expose hidden implementation details or violate state invariance maintained by the methods.*

#### Private Method

*Private methods are those methods which can't be accessed in other class except the class in which they are declared. We can perform the functionality only within the class in which they are declared.*

*Private methods are useful for breaking tasks up into smaller parts, or for preventing duplication of code which is needed often by other methods in a class, but should not be called outside of that class.*

### Inheritence

*It is a mechanism where you can to derive a class from another class for a hierarchy of classes that share a set of attributes and methods.*

*Inheritance is a mechanism in which one class acquires the property of another class. For example, a child inherits the traits of his/her parents. With inheritance, we can reuse the fields and methods of the existing class. Hence, inheritance facilitates Reusability and is an important concept of OOPs.*
